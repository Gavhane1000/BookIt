Emily Cooper's boss Madeline prepares to transition from the Chicago-based pharmaceutical marketing firm, the Gilbert Group, to a French fashion firm, Savoir, when she discovers she is pregnant. The Gilbert Group offers the job to Emily, who accepts, leaving her boyfriend back in Chicago. Emily moves to Paris even though she does not speak French. She changes her Instagram handle from @emilycooper to @emilyinparis and begins documenting her time in Paris. Emily starts her first day of work much to the chagrin of her new co-workers, who reveal that she was only hired because of a business deal. She introduces the French, who seem reluctant about her and her American methods, to American social media strategies. Emily accidentally tries to enter the wrong apartment and meets her neighbor Gabriel. As Emily becomes accustomed to life in Paris, she makes countless faux-pas, and her colleagues nickname her "la plouc" or "the hick".

Annoyed with the gendered nature of the French language, Emily writes a post about the product, which goes viral, causing her to make further inroads at work.

When the campaign goes viral, Antoine sends Emily La Perla lingerie as a thank-you gift. Mindy proposes a dinner party to help Emily meet new people, but the party turns into a rager. She meets a French man, and they hit it off, but Emily returns to Gabriel's restaurant for comfort after the man offends her.

After a miscommunication that renders her work dinner reservation at an exclusive, luxurious restaurant invalid, Emily convinces Gabriel to host them at his restaurant instead.
